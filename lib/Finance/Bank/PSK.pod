=head1 WARNING

This is code for B<online banking>, and that means B<your money>, and that
means B<BE CAREFUL>. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit the source 
of this module yourself to reassure yourself that I am not doing anything 
untoward with your banking data. This software is useful to me, but is 
provided under B<NO GUARANTEE>, explicit or implied.
